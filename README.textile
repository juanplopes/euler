h1. To run any example, just call:

@boo/booi N.boo@ [where N is the problem number]

h1. Bad performance ones:

The ones below just have poor performance (although they give the answer in less than 1 minute).

* 0003 (primes)
* 0005 (integer division)
* 0010 (primes) EXTREME
* 0014 (volume, repeated ops)

h1. Using control structures

Trying to use always functional approach. But some of them I just couldn't do that.

* 0013 (for, if)
